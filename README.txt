LOOSIPHER OS

This is a hobby OS being built to learn more about computers and how they tick.
To build the project, just enter the main directory and run `make` or `make all`.
The former cleans all build artifacts and then builds while the latter just builds.
The Makefile assumes a toolchain with the target prefix i686-elf- is in the PATH
already.
